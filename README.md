## üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Turnstile Solver ‚Äì Shadow DOM Handler

This project is a Python automation script that simulates user interaction to **bypass Cloudflare Turnstile challenges** by locating and triggering the validation input inside **nested Shadow DOM elements**. It uses Selenium with `undetected-chromedriver` to reduce detection and access deeply embedded iframe and shadow-root structures.

---

### üì¶ Features

* Automatically detects and interacts with Cloudflare Turnstile challenges.
* Navigates through **Shadow DOM** and nested **iframes** using Selenium.
* Clicks the challenge input using JavaScript execution.
* Built to work with the official [2Captcha Cloudflare demo page](https://2captcha.com/es/demo/cloudflare-turnstile).
* Uses `undetected-chromedriver` to avoid automation detection.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Google Chrome
* Chromedriver (automatically handled by `undetected-chromedriver`)
